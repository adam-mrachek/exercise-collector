# Exercise Collector

This is a simple application that allows you to build up a collection of exercises
that you've learned about and want to be able to easily reference when planning/programming workouts.

You can organize exercises by muscle group, type (strength, mobility), and required equipment. You can also add one or more links to how-to videos.
